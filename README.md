# Near Protocol Chat Application

## Overview

This is a simple chat application built on the Near Protocol. It allows users to send and receive messages on the Near blockchain.

## Refer to:

- [smart contract](./smart-contract) for the smart contract.
- [BOS Component](https://github.com/Tevin-Isaac/NEAR-CHAT-BOS-component) for the BOS Component.

### Note:

The smart contract and BOS component are two separate codebases and do not relate with each other as the smart contract was tested locally and on testnet while BOS cannot be tested on testnet.
